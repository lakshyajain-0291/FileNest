# Contributing to FileNest ü§ù

Welcome to FileNest! We're excited that you want to contribute to our Multi-Modal Intelligent Search Engine over Decentralized Data. This guide will help you get started, whether you're a first-time contributor or an experienced developer.

## üåü First Time Contributing? You're Welcome Here!

Don't worry if you're new to open source! FileNest is designed to be a learning-friendly project. We believe everyone has something valuable to contribute, regardless of experience level.

### What You'll Learn
- **AI/ML**: Semantic embeddings, multimodal content analysis, and intelligent search
- **Distributed Systems**: P2P networking, consensus algorithms, and decentralized architectures  
- **Backend Development**: Go development, API design, and system architecture
- **Frontend Development**: React.js, CLI tools, and user experience design

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- Git (for version control)
- Go 1.21+ (for backend development)
- Python 3.9+ (for AI/ML components)
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

**Installation:**

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub (click the "Fork" button)

# 2. Clone YOUR fork (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FileNest.git
cd FileNest

# 3. Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lakshyajain-0291/FileNest.git

# 4. Install dependencies for each component
# Backend
cd backend && go mod tidy && cd ..

# AI/ML (if requirements.txt exists)
cd ai && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Frontend (if package.json exists)  
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

### Step 2: Find Something to Work On

**For Beginners:**
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `beginner-friendly`
- Check out the [documentation improvements](docs/) - always a great starting point!
- Fix typos, improve comments, or add examples

**For Intermediate Contributors:**
- Issues labeled `help wanted` or `enhancement`
- Adding new features to existing components
- Writing tests for existing functionality

**For Advanced Contributors:**
- Complex features requiring multiple components
- Performance optimizations
- Architecture improvements

### Step 3: Create a Branch and Start Coding

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on the main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# 2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
git checkout -b your-feature-name

# Example branch names:
# git checkout -b add-pdf-support
# git checkout -b fix-search-latency
# git checkout -b improve-contributing-docs
```

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

**Best Practices:**
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Add tests if you're adding new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Follow the existing code style

**Commit Message Format:**
```
type: short description

Longer description if needed

Examples:
feat: add PDF content extraction support
fix: resolve search timeout issue
docs: improve contributing instructions for beginners
test: add unit tests for embedding generation
```

### Step 5: Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run tests for the component you changed
cd backend && go test ./... && cd ..
cd ai && python -m pytest && cd ..
cd frontend && npm test && cd ..

# Test the entire system if possible
./scripts/test.sh  # (if this script exists)
```

### Step 6: Submit a Pull Request

```bash
# 1. Push your changes to your fork
git push origin your-feature-name

# 2. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
# - Click "Compare & pull request" button
# - Fill out the PR template with details about your changes
# - Reference any related issues with "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"
```
